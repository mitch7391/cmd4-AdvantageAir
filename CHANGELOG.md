# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 3.11.0 (2024-01-10)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for executing these new features! Make sure to run the ConfigCreator again to update your config and take advantage of the new features!

### Notable Changes

* Accessory names can now handle a single quote `'`, for example `Mitch's Room`. You must also update `homebridge-cmd4` to `v7.0.2` to take advantage of this feature.
* For users with `myZone` taking advantage of the 'Fan' Zone Control setup, since iOS 17 the `SwingMode` characteristic we were using to be the `myZone` switch has disappeared from the accessory's Homekit primary page but hidden deep inside the accessory's Homekit settings. Now we are using the `RotationDirection` characteristic rather than `SwingMode` as a proxy for the `myZone` switch. `RotationDirection` characteristic will show as a round button switch on the Homekit accessory's primary page.

### Other Changes

* Performance Update: MyPlace `lights` and `things` will now use ID instead of Name as a parameter in `state_cmd_suffix` during the ConfigCreator process, requiring less parsing in `AdvAir.sh`.
* Dev: Added unit tests to for `lights` and `things` ID as a parameter in `state_cmd_suffix` and also added unit tests to test for `RotationDirection` characteristics.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed: Broken url path to the homebridge logo on the `README`.


## 3.10.0 (2023-07-28)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for executing these new features!

### Notable Changes

Some great Zone Control customisation options have come to the `ConfigCreator` based on how different people would like to use this plug-in! All you have to do is run the `ConfigCreator` to try them out or update your config! As always, take a copy of your existing config first just in case you would like to quickly revert back to what you already had.

* "Lightbulb/Switch" * accessory with standalone temperature sensor and myZone switch (legacy).
* "Lightbulb/Switch" * accessory with integrated temperature sensor but standalone myZone switch (new).
* "Lightbulb" only accessory with integrated temperature sensor but standalone myZone switch (new).
* "Fan" accessory with integrated temperature sensor and integrated myZone switch (new - recommended).

_*_ will use a Switch for temperature sensor zones and a Lightbulb for those without.

Read more about these options in Step 10 of the [README](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir#readme). If you have ideas for further config options, let us know!

### Other Changes

* Support for Fujitsu anywAIR systems, which seem to be a rebranded AdvantageAir System using port `10211`. As such, the PORT option has been added to the `ConfigCreator` and can be left as default for all AdvantageAir users and changed for anywAIR users.
* Added an optional performance enhancement by doing the necessary rounding in Cmd4 module.
* Dev: Dependency updates.
* Dev: Added unit tests for the additional characteristics `Active` and `SwingMode`.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed: A vulnerability was found in `ConfigCreator.sh` for use in terminal. It would fail if an optional retries parameter was added in the `config.json`.
* Fixed: A bug was found in `AdvAir.sh` such that when the aircon system is offline, the plugin still registers it as online.


## 3.9.0 (2023-03-09)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) and [ztalbot2000](https://github.com/ztalbot2000) for adding these new features!

### Notable Changes

*  `myZone` - Will no longer blanket set the 'Target Temperature' from the Thermostat across all zones for myZone users. This functionality has been good for non-myZone users but should not be the case for myZone users; only the 'Target Temperature' of the zone defined as myZone is changed. This change will not affect non-myZone users.
*  `Fancy Timers` - New 'switch to mode timers' can be added from the `ConfigCreator` (needs to be run again to added to your config). These timers will add the functionality to change from one mode to the next after the timer is complete.
   * Cool: Switch to Cool mode once the timer is completed.
   * Heat: Switch to Heat mode once the timer is completed.
   * Vent (fan): Switch to Fan mode once the timer is completed.
* `No Response` - Previously if the Advantage Air device could not be reached, it would show the status as `Off`, but with homebridge-cmd4 `v7.0.0` (currently available via beta version `v7.0.0-beta2`) it will now display as `No Response`. This particularly usefull for users with the MyPlace smart extra modules which can go offline seperate of the main control unit.

### Other Changes

* Various under the hood quality of life and error handling improvements.

### Bug Fixes

* Yellow log warning 'requires Node.js version' fixed. `Node.js` dependancy updated.
* Red log error 'No plugin was found' fixed. If you still see this error, clear the area of your config that contains the following and run `ConfigCreator` again:

```json
        {
            "name": "cmd4AdvantageAir",
            "devices": [
                {
                    "name": "Aircon",
                    "ipAddress": "192.168.0.159"
                }
            ],
            "platform": "cmd4AdvantageAir"
        }
```


## 3.8.0 (2022-09-26)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for executing these new features!

### Notable Changes

* Support added for `myZone`. For users that have access to `myZone`, this will expose a series of switch accessories that will allow the user to set which room is currently being used as `myZone` for temperature feedback to the Advantage Air controller. 
   * To add the `myZone` switches to you system, please run the ConfigCreator to add them to your config (Step 8 of the [README](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir#readme)).
   * More information on what `myZone` is can be found [here](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1310157/Advantage-Air-Myair.html?page=17).

### Other Changes

* All defined `Constant Zones` are now used by `AdAvir.sh` when before it would only use the first defined `Constant Zone`.
* Better handling of systems that are a mix of zones with and without temperature sensors.


## 3.7.0 (2022-09-04)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for executing this new feature! And happy birthday to my cat Pumpkin, the Red Menace!

### Notable Changes

* Much like how the new `ConfigCreator` can be run from the terminal for HOOBS users and Homebridge users without access to the web UI; the existing `CheckConfig` web UI button can now also be called from the terminal. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#checkconfig).
* The `CheckConfig` script when called, will run through all the requirements of the plug-in installation steps and your config to make sure you are all set!

### Other Changes

* The `ConfigCreator` script will now prompt you to call the `CheckConfig` script in the very last steps.


## 3.6.0 (2022-08-28)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for adding this new feature!

### Notable Changes

The new `ConfigCreator` can now be run from Homebridge UI! Once the Advantage Air device(s) is/are defined (note that only a maximum of 3 devices can be processed by `ConfigCreator`) and saved, click the `CONFIG CREATOR` button to auto-create the cmd4 configuration file required to run the `homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir` plugin. Make sure you check the checkbox if you want the fan to be setup as `FanSwitch` instead of a 'Fan' accessory before you click the `CONFIG CREATOR` button. 

This can be run by existing users if they want to update to the newest (and best!) config options available. You can always inspect or edit the configuration created in `homebridge-cmd4` (not `homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir`) JASON Config editor if you want after the fact; for example if you do not like the naming convention used. Once the configuration is created, you can then use the `CHECK CONFIGURATION` button to check whether the configuration meets all the requirements. 

<I><B> NOTE: </B> HOOBS users and users without access to Homebridge UI have to run the `ConfigCreator` from their terminal and follow the prompts. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#configcreator). </I>

### Other Changes

* Addition of `FanSwitch` config option. For users who would rather have the Advantage Air fan as a `Switch` accessory instead of a `Fan` accessory. Fan speed will still be coupled and controlled with the `FanSwitch` accessory like it is with the `Thermostat`.
* Terminal mode of `ConfigCreator.sh` now has improved instructions in coloured form.

### Bug Fixes

* Dev: All lint errors resolved.
* Dev: Removed prepare script for husky


## 3.5.1 (2022-08-02)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for adding this new feature!

### Bug Fixes

* Replaced use of command `tac` to `sort -nr` in new `ConfigCreator` (see `v3.5.0` below). Command `tac` is not available on macOS.


## 3.5.0 (2022-08-02)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for adding this new feature!

### Notable Changes

* New `ConfigCreator` script to automatically craft your homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir config! This feature is particularly helpful for users with larger MyPlace systems containing Lights, Garage Doors, etc., who can have over 100 accessories; but new and existing users with smaller systems can still benefit from this feature!
   * You can choose to have the script generate a cmd4 config file for you to copy and paste into your existing `config.json` or opt to allow it to automaticaly add itself to your `config.json` to save you the effort of the copy/paste. This will not overwrite any other existing cmd4 accessories outside of this project.
   * Instructions on how to run this script can be found [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#configcreator-instructions).

### Other Changes

* Dev: `timeout` increased for `Server.js` unit tests to be more suitable to dev testing on RPi.


## 3.4.0 (2022-06-10)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) and [ztalbot2000](https://github.com/ztalbot2000) for adding these new features!

### Notable Changes

* Support for Advantage Air systems with a second control tablet! This is for users who may have multiple aircons controlled by separate control tablets.
* Thermostat `Auto` mode is now used to set `dry` mode in Advantage Air control unit. This enable users to set the `dry` mode from Homekit.
* Performance: New function to update `myAirData.txt` cache file immediately after every `Set` command using `jq` so that the cache file always reflects the latest state of the system in real time.
* Minimized "write" events to the disk as per [issue #58](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/issues/58).

### Other Changes

* Created temporary sub-directory to store all temporary files required for the smooth running of `AdvAir.sh`.
* Dev: New `AirconServer` for better and more realistic unit testing.
* Dev: Real time count down capability is added to the `AirconServer` to make it behave more like a real aircon system.

### Bug Fixes

* Resolve issue where `AdvAir.sh` fails to write to `"/tmp"` which is denied in some Linux distros; as per [issue #58](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/issues/58). 
* Issue where `countDownToOn` timer is set and if the aircon is turned on manually instead, the `countDownToOn` remains on. It should be turned off because the aircon is now on.
* Minor bug fixes to new `AirconServer`.
* Dev: NPM Audit to fix issues with dependencies causing unit tests to fail.


## 3.3.0 (2022-03-25)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) and [ztalbot2000](https://github.com/ztalbot2000) for adding these new features! Another special thanks to John Wong and Kai Millar for all the beta testing that made this feature possible!

### Notable Changes

* MyPlace [Extras](https://www.advantageair.com.au/small-smarts-add-ons/) support!!!
  * Lights - both simple on/off and dimmable. Config examples can be found [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#lightbulbs-1).
  * Garage Door Opener for Garage Doors and Gates. Config example can be found [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#garage-door-and-gate).
* Support for Advantage Air systems with more than one air conditioners! You can add up to 5 aircons if they are all accessible from the one control tablet. Config examples can be found [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#multiple-aircons)
* MyPlace users with the extras should set `"timeout"` in their config to `60000`.
* It is reccomended to change `"queueType"` from `"WoRm"` to `"WoRm2"` for better performance.

### Other Changes

* MyPlace smart eco-systems required large scale under the hood changes to manage the communication between Cmd4 and the Advantage Air Controllers. Greater detail can be found in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/pull/37).
* MyPlace Extras are now independent of the aircon system; for those who do not want to add the aircon system to HomeKit.
* Use of the `flip` constant in the `"state_cmd_suffix"` of your garage door or gate; incase the Advantage Air has installed it backwards!

### Bug Fixes

* Fix the close multiple zones bug that causes constant zone to open to 100%.
* Setting Thermostat to 'auto' from HomeKit will now default the Thermostat to the mode it was already on.
* Shellcheck cleared out over 60 syntax errors in the script that could have posed issues.
* Dev unit test fixes.


## 3.2.0 (2022-02-04)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for adding these new features! Thank you to all who participated in the beta testing! 

### Notable Changes

* Zone closing check to ensure that at least one zone is open at all times as a secondary layer of protection for your ducting.
   * If you close all zones, it will open your Constant Zone damper to 100%.
* No longer require the use of `noSensors` in your `config.json`. The script determines if you have sensors or not.
* Temperature Sensor users no longer require to add zone (`z01`, `z02`, etc.) to `"state_cmd_suffix"` of Thermostat in your `config.json`. The script determines and sets it as your Constant Zone.
   * You can still set a zone if you prefer to choose a different zone to your Constant Zone. 
* Countdown timer added as a Lightbulb accessory; config can be found [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#timer).
   * Depending on if your Advantage Air system is on or off will determine if the countdown is to turn the system on or off when it reaches 0.
   * New constant `timer` will need to be added to the `"state_cmd_suffix"` of this accessory.
   * The Advantage Air system will only allow 720 minutes (12 hours) for a timer and the Lightbulb has 0-100% to utilise. 
      * Therefore, setting 1% will equal 10 minutes, 6% will be equal to 1 hour.
      * Setting a value higher than 72% (720 minutes), will default back to 72% on the Lightbulb.

### Other Changes

* Shell Check Tool updated for new configurations. Always check you `config.json` with this after making changes!
* Dev dependancy `nanoid` security update to `v3.1.31`.


## 3.1.0 (2022-01-18)

Special thanks to the amazing [uswong](https://github.com/uswong) for adding the new fan speed feature and fixing the zone percentage bug! Thank you to all who participated in the beta testing! 

### Notable Changes

* Fan speed added to Fan accessory via charcteristic `rotationSpeed`. See new Fan config [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#fan)!
   * Speeds: 1-33% (low), 34-67% (medium), 68-99% (high) and 100% ('auto' or 'ezfan').
* Fan speed added to Thermostat accessory via new `"linkedType"` config options; see new Thermostat config [here](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki/Config-Creation#thermostat-with-fan-speed). You may need to delete the [Homebridge cache](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/issues/27#issuecomment-997779309) when updating this accessory.
   * Speeds: 1-33% (low), 34-67% (medium), 68-99% (high) and 100% ('auto' or 'ezfan'). 
* New [Wiki](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/wiki) page to help explain and create your `config.json`.
* <B>Homebridge Verified!!!</B>

### Other Changes

* Thermostat 'Fan Speed' `"linkedType"` is set to always appear on.
* If you do not opt into using fan speeds for the Fan and/or Thermostat; setting mode commands (`cool`/`heat`/`on`) will now default to the last known speed set in the Advantage Air app (low/medium/high/auto/'ezfan'). It used to always set to `auto` speed when changing modes.
* Removal of unused `statusFault` and redundant new code from `AdvAir.sh`.
* Streamlining and updates for the README. Moving of some information to the new Wiki.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix for Zone percentage (`brightness`) which would not send value to the controller if it was not rounded to 5%; value input now will round to the nearest 5%.
* Fix for users with 'ezfan' mode defaulting to 'high'; 'ezfan' mode now accepted as 100% speed.
* Dev Tests: Fix timeout issues with `server.js`.


## 3.0.3 (2021-12-29)

Welcome to our Homebridge UI integration!!! 

All the credit for this integration goes to the amazing John Talbot of [homebridge-cmd4](https://github.com/ztalbot2000/homebridge-cmd4); I seriously cannot thank him enough! While this is still not its own independent plug-in, this integration will mimic a 'full' plug-in for Homebridge UI. This includes prompts for updates to your scripts, no longer having to edit the script and a configuration check tool to make sure you are set up correctly. Please take a look at the [README](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/tree/master#readme) for more information.

### Other Changes

### Breaking Changes

* Homebridge UI integration. While this change itself will not break your existing setup; the process of migrating over might while getting set up again if you make a mistake.
* IP address is removed from the `AdvAir.sh` script. It is now added as a constant in the `homebridge-cmd4` config and in `"state_cmd_suffix"` (see [Config_Samples](https://github.com/mitch7391/cmd4-AdvantageAir/tree/master/Config_Samples) directory). There is no longer a need for users to edit the script!

### Notable Changes

* [#9](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/issues/19): Add zone percentage control for users without temperature sensors. This is integrated as the Light Bulb acessory (see [Config_Samples](https://github.com/mitch7391/cmd4-AdvantageAir/tree/master/Config_Samples)).  

### Bug Fixes

* [#19](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/issues/19): Add `noSensors` variable to fix issue with Thermostat Get CurrentTemperature for users without temperature sensors.
* Side issue bug raised in [#9](https://github.com/mitch7391/homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir/issues/9): `noSensors` variable fixes issue with Thermostat Set CurrentTemperature for users without temperature sensors.

### Other Changes

* README updated: Update supported units, update screenshots, update and streamline installation instructions.
* Config samples updated: Update and streamline config samples. `noSensors` and `${IP}` added to `config.json`. Example added for users with some (but not all) zones using temperature sensors.
* Issue templates updated.
* PR template created.
* CHANGELOG created.
* Repo/Plug-in name changed from `cmd4-AdvantageAir` to `homebridge-cmd4-AdvantageAir`.
* Dev unit tests expanded and updated.


## 2.3.0 (2021-09-30)

### Notable Changes

* `config.json` changes to stop warnings in the upcoming homebridge-cmd4 v6.0.0 release.
* Characteristics now require the starting letter to be 'lower case' and not 'upper case'; this will pave the way for future work John Talbot puts in for cmd4 to have a `config-schema.json` in Homebridge UI.


## 2.2.0 (2021-09-15)

### Notable Changes

* Removed `stdbuf` dependency from scripts (could affect macOS user installs).
* Install instructions in `README` have been split into Raspbian and macOS installs; still no Windows install instructions.
* `IP Address` / `Port Number` at start of script has had the port number moved into the script commands; so users do not need to think they need to change the port number or figure it out themselves.


## 2.1.0 (2021-08-22)

### Notable Changes

* Addition of test scripts.


## 2.0.0 (2021-08-18)

### Breaking Changes

* New singular script `AdvAir.sh` to replace the need of two scripts `ezone.sh` and `zones.sh` ('Two Constant Zone' users will still have to use two scripts for now; sorry!).
* Better error handling and reporting; script will attempt 5 iterations to receive a valid reading from the control unit.
* Introduction and use of homebridge-cmd4's new `WoRm` (Write once Read many) queue designed by John Talbot to better handle interactions with Advantage Air control unit's limitations.

### Notable Changes

* Repo rename to `cmd4-AdvantageAir`; this is to more accurately capture the broader control units this API encompasses.
* Temperature Sensor Low Battery warning indications added.
* `config.json` improvements and clean-up.
* Documentation improvements in `README`.


## 1.2.0 (2021-02-08)

### Notable Changes

* New `config.json` examples added for the new polling methods of cmd4 v3.0.x.
* Updated `README`.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a couple of small bugs in shell scripts: use of `"true"` instead of `'1'` for `On` characteristic and double use of case `* )`.


## 1.1.0 (2021-01-22)

### Notable Changes

* Added shell scripts for users without Temperature Sensors.
* Issue templates added for `Bug Report`, `Feature Request` and `Support Request`.
* 'House Keeping' of directories for better navigation to shell scripts needed.
* Updated `README`.
